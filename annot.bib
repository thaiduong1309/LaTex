  annote    = {The Marines have increasing battery needs as fighting technology puts higher demands on the power they use. In an effort to offset this demand, the marines are investigating alternative energy sources, one being solar power. Mobile photovoltaics (PV) are a technology that can address these needs by leveraging flexible high efficiency III-V photovoltaic technology. The development of a lightweight, high efficiency solar panel to mount on, or stow in, a backpack and used to recharge a warfighters' battery was demonstrated. The panel consists of a 10 × 3 solar array of 20 cm2 epitaxial lift-off (ELO) Inverted Metamorphic (IMM) triple junction solar cells. In the first two phases of the project, single-junction GaAs cells with an efficiency of ~ 21% under AM1.5 illumination were used. Several of these systems were outfitted during Limited Objective Experiments (LOE) in February 2012 and August 2012. In the third and most current phase of this project, panels of triple-junction cells with an expected efficiency of 28-30% under AM1.5 illumination. Data from these LOEs are presented here. Although the panels are expensive, they have been demonstrated as a viable technology.}

  annote    = {You can’t collect solar power at night. Well, at least not on Earth. Since it’s Space Week, we thought it'd be appropriate to look at one promising, but futuristic, idea that could change the face of solar power generation: Space-Based Solar Power (SBSP). While the Energy Department is not actively researching SBSP, we hope you’ll take a moment to learn about this far out concept.

The idea of capturing solar power in space for use as energy on Earth has been around since the beginning of the space age. In the last few years, however, scientists around the globe -- and several researchers at the Energy Department’s own Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) -- have shown how recent technological developments could make this concept a reality.

On earth, solar power is greatly reduced by night, cloud cover, atmosphere and seasonality. Some 30 percent of all incoming solar radiation never makes it to ground level. In space the sun is always shining, the tilt of the Earth doesn't prevent the collection of power and there’s no atmosphere to reduce the intensity of the sun’s rays. This makes putting solar panels into space a tempting possibility. Additionally, SBSP can be used to get reliable and clean energy to people in remote communities around the world, without relying on the traditional grid to a large local power plant.}

Most importantly, it is environmentally friendly, clean energy}
